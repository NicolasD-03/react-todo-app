# A beautiful todo app made with react 📝

This project is my first project with react.

## The goal oh this app

With this app you can write some todos that are saved in the local storage of your browser. Pretty simple to use.

### How to set-up the app

To set-up the app you need to use `Node` in version `14.17.5` or above. Also you need to install `npm`.\
If you have this prerequisites you can go in your favorite shell and clone this project into your development folder.\
Once you have the project you can move into the cloned folder and run this list of commands :

### `npm -i`

Install the `node_modules` use for the development.\
The modules are presents in the `package.json`.\
You can use this if you want to modify the code.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
